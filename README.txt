In the past this folder was only containing the basic html for the web and the pdf were hosting on files.pharo.org such as http://files.pharo.org/books-pdfs/updated-pharo-by-example/2017-01-14-UpdatedPharoByExample.pdf

Now we are migrating the pdf to be under /pdf because we will also have /html and this is simpler to have everything under the same folder.
